#### Hello!
Hi! I'm Jon.  
[(resum√©)](/assets/resume.pdf)

#### What do you do?
As of September 2018, I'll be working as a consultant with Booz Allen Hamilton in Washington, D.C.

#### What _can_ you do?
I have training as a data scientist, customer service representative, coffeeshop barista, and psychology
researcher.   
Some of the skills I've picked up along the way include:

- multivariate data analysis and machine learning
  - regression algorithms
  - classification algorithms
  - natural language processing  
- presenting findings to mixed audiences (it's not just about pretty slides!)  
- working proficiency in Python
- familiarity with R and RStudio
- research study administration

#### Where do you see yourself in a year?
In a position where I can continue to learn tremendously from people who've been doing data science and analytics
longer than I have.

#### Five years?
The same as above, but I'd also love to be an educator of some sort. I've never gotten to flex my teaching muscles,
and it's something I've always wanted to get into.

#### Anything else?
I love to eat, sing, and get lost in the woods whenever I can!
