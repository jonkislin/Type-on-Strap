#### Hello!
Hi! I'm Jon, and I'm a graduate of [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com)
in New York City.

[My resum√©](/assets/resume.pdf)

#### What do you do?
Currently on the job hunt!     
While I search, I'm brushing up on SQL, javascript, and topics in machine learning
and Natural Language Processing.

#### What _can_ you do?
I have training as a data scientist, customer service representative, and psychology
researcher.   
Some of the skills I've picked up along the way include:

- multivariate data analysis and machine learning
  - regression algorithms
  - classification algorithms
  - natural language processing  
- presenting findings to mixed audiences (it's not just about pretty slides!)  
- working proficiency in Python
- familiarity with R and RStudio
- research study administration

#### Where do you see yourself in a year?
In a position where I can learn tremendously from people who've been doing data science
longer than I have.

#### Whose work inspires you?
Check out these fine folks:  
[linda skitka](http://lskitka.people.uic.edu/index.html), [matt motyl](http://motyl.people.uic.edu), [ravi iyer](http://www.polipsych.com/about/),
[jonathan haidt](http://people.stern.nyu.edu/jhaidt/)   

#### Anything else?
I love to eat, sing, and get lost in the woods whenever I can!
