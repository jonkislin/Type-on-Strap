Final project at Metis Data Science Bootcamp. Blog post in progress.  
[Click here](https://github.com/jonkislin/traverse) for a link to my project repo.

This project was heavily inspired by Tim Martin's excellent [Promoting Positive Climate Change Discussions on Twitter](https://zeromh.github.io/climate_change_conversations/).

Visualizations made possible by [Andrei Kashcha](https://github.com/anvaka/pm).

### Motivation:
Some thoughts from [Dan Hopkins at 538](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/political-twitter-is-no-place-for-moderates):  
> ....if someone tweets about politics, they are likely to label themselves as on the edges of the American ideological distribution. People who deem themselves “very conservative” or “very liberal” seem to be telling us as much about their level of political engagement as about their policy positions.

Some more thoughts:   

>We asked a [representative sample] of American adults about their Twitter usage and found that as of November/December 2016, just 12 percent of our respondents reported using the social media platform. So Twitter posters are already a distinct minority, and even among those who do tweet, users who routinely tweet about politics are an even smaller and more atypical minority. Political tweeters are even more polarized than the nation as a whole.

Can we find the moderates on twitter?
Where would we find them?

### Tweet collection
Some basics to figure out:
- How many tweets would be an appropriate sample?
- What query should we use?
- What constitutes an edge? Nodes will be users.
