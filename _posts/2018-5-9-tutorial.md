I decided that, to keep this blog-train going, and prove to myself that I'm being
productive while I'm not sending out applications and networking, I'd highlight some
of the awesome tutorials I spend my mornings watching and taking notes on, and discuss some
of the things I learned. At worst, this will be a reminder to myself of my own progress, and at best,
perhaps someone will see this post and get to see what I've seen.

So here we go: [3blue1Brown](http://www.3blue1brown.com).
What a refreshing video series! Every video so far, from
Fourier Transforms to basic Linear Algebra to Neural Networks has been crystal clear,
well-paced, and engaging. No surprise, as the
